# UNG TV Switching Tablet

While working at the University's AV Department, I came up with this proof of concept for a raspberry pi tablet that is able to control the TVs through CEC commands. Since this is only a proof of concept, the inital design has been completed but the CEC functionalliy needs to be added on. The program is ready for the addition of the commands and built in classes for each button's action have been implemented.
